# SICity 

In this project, we present several experiments done with SICity to demonstrate its capabilities. 

## Mixing physical vehicles and cloud vehicles

### The formation of the platoon for experiment 1 is shown below.

(Demo scenario: there are ten HDVs following the CAV, which only responds to the motion of the two HDVs directly behind)

The CAV maintains car-following operations, adapting to the states of its preceding vehicles, and it also aims to **lead the motion of its following vehicles**. Specifically, by controlling of the CAV, LCC aims for both of the following two objectives:

1. **attenuate downstream traffic perturbations**;
2. **smooth upstream traffic flow**.
